# Rock, Paper & Scissor
### Rock, paper & scissor is a simple game for all ages. It's most common to play as kids but even grown ups play this game to settle the differences between the players. Whoever win, best of three wins the dispute between two people.

### This version of the game offers fire and water to make the game a little more fun with different options. This inspired me after watching a episode of the sitcom series Friends.


## How to play:

### Rock crushes scissor.
### Scissor cuts paper.
### Papper captures rock.

## Fire & water can only be used "once" a game each.
### Fire burns rock, paper & scissor
### Water puts out fire but can not defeat rock, paper & scissor.

## Three results:
### Win
### Lose
### Draw
